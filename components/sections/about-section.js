						Hello! My name is Rogene and I enjoy creating things that live on
						the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
						when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out
						hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
						CSS!
					</p>
					<p>
						Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
						advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
						student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
						accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
						Upstatement for a variety of clients.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
						build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
					</p>
					<p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
					<ul className={styles["about__tech-stack"]}>
						{techStack.map((stack, index) => (
							<li key={index}>{stack}</li>
						))}
					</ul>
